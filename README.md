# Cover Buddy

**Cover Buddy** is an iOS app for designing beautiful custom playlist covers.

Simply choose a background from the wide variety of presets, then customize the text font, size, colors, and positioning to truly make it yours. 

Save your custom designs to your cover library, then export them to your photo library and get help setting them as your playlist cover in Spotify, Apple Music, Deezer, and more. 

If you want to see pretty pictures and learn about how it was made, read on. If you just want to play with the code, hop right in ðŸ˜Š.

## Tech stack

Cover Buddy is built with Swift 5 and SwiftUI 2.0

It makes use of Core Data and CloudKit for data storage and syncing. 

## Dependencies

There are no dependencies required to make it work.

It does, however, come including [the amazing UIImageColors utility](https://github.com/jathu/UIImageColors) which is used for fetching colors from the backgrounds. Shout out to them for that awesome piece of kit. 

## Fun/useful parts
 - `BackgroundBlurView`, a SwiftUI `View` to be used in .background() modifier or under views to provide the native frosted glass effect. Simply wraps a `UIVisualEffectView` with `UIBlurEffect` thin style.
- `SpicyStack`, a SwiftUI `View` that takes another `View` in as content and places it in either an HStack or a VStack depending on the window size. Useful for building layouts that adapt between iOS and iPadOS. 

## Feedback
If you have any feedback about the code or want to contribute, please open a Pull Request, an Issue, or shoot me an e-mail. This is only my second SwiftUI application and I'm always open to constructive criticism.
